# scripts_misc

This repository provides a consistent URL to call several R scripts that optimize use of a number of R functions within harmonization and analysis pipelines for the Accelerating Data to Achieve Personalized Treatment (ADAPT) framework.  Most functions are wrappers of R function for certain tasks.  However there are some packages that encode clinical calculations, risk models, and definitions.
